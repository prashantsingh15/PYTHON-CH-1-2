x =  (type(10)) 
y = (type("abcd"))
print(x)  # it is takenm as a string not as a variable


#if anything is wriiteen in "" double qoutes then it is  treated as a  string in python so when "multiple " 
# is passed in the print function , it takes it as a string not as a variable.... 
#so thats why it will return multiple not 10*20= 200..
